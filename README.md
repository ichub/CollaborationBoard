## Summary

![](./demo.gif)
This project is a real-time collaborative online whiteboard. Sort of like Google docs, but for drawing. You can find a live demo of this project (renamed to paper together) here: [http://papertogether.com/](http://papertogether.com/).

### If you want to try it out...
Go to the above url (or click [here](http://papertogether.com/)) and click the "Create a Sheet" button. After the subsequent page loads, you can immediately start drawing. If you want to test out how real-time it actually is, you can open another tab next to the one you already have, and copy/paste the page's URL into that one. When you draw on either of the instances of that page, your edits should show up in real time.

### Technologies used

* C# ASP.NET MVC
* SignalR for sockets
